Ideal Recommendation Photo Tool

This is a recommendation tool for taking photos.
It's made with python.

What this tool does is too recommend you the perfect adjustment to your camera.
As many of you know, camera has versatile settings. It also has a pro mode to customize your own settings to get great results.

But, many of amateur photographers have hard times adjusting the best settings to get the right moment of the photo they want.
To make sure many individual photographers could take more photos like a pro, I made this tool to help you.

How does it works?

First, you take a shot, and the system analyze the photos histogram and tells you how the picture is. From darkest -> dark -> Medium -> Light -> Lighter(Brighter)
If the brightess is perfect, you'll get the message quote: "Brightness is optimal. Keep maintaining the brightness."
If it's not you'll get this quote: "Brightness is low. Need flash or additional light sources.

Second, it shows you the result of original photo, adding brightness / sharpening & edge detection of the photo.
You can compare side by side.

Lastly, it recommends you too adjust your settings of the camera. This means you should adjust your setting of brightness, sharpening, and contrast.
It shows you the recommended adjust image comparing with your original photo.

I hope this tool help you to take good photos without hesitation.
